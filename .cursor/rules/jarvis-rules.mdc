1. Every Function Must Fit in a Human Brain (‚â† 30 lines)
Keep functions small and focused. A single function should do one thing, and do it clearly. If a function exceeds 30 lines, consider breaking it down.

---

2. No Abbreviations in Names
Variable, function, and file names should be fully spelled out (e.g. `scrape_google_maps()`, not `scrpGMaps()`). Prioritize clarity over keystrokes.

---

3. Each Script Must Be Readable Top-to-Bottom
Organize scripts so they read like a story: imports ‚Üí constants ‚Üí helpers ‚Üí main logic ‚Üí execution. Avoid jumping up and down to understand control flow.

---

## 4. Avoid Cleverness; Be Boring but Clear
Do not optimize for brilliance. Optimize for another dev (or your future self)** to open the file and say ‚ÄúI get it.‚Äù  
‚úÖ `for lead in leads:`  - GOOD
‚ùå `leads.map(lambda x: x.do(thing))` - NOT GOOD

---

5. Declare All External Dependencies at the Top
All APIs, libraries, keys, or CLI tools must be clearly declared in a `requirements.txt` or `install.sh`, and also mentioned at the top of the script or in a README section.

---

6. Every Component Must Be Usable in Isolation
Whether it's a scraper, AI prompt, or deployer ‚Äî it must be callable/testable from a single function or CLI entry point. This makes automation chaining and testing easier.

---

7. Every Output Must Be Structured
Store outputs (CSV, JSON, logs, site folders) with clear file names and folders using this format:  
`output/{module_name}/{date}/[project_name].[ext]`  
Avoid cluttered root folders and hardcoded paths.

---

8. Log Everything that Happens, Once
Every important action (e.g. scraping started, file saved, API called, deploy completed) must log a message to console or file. Keep logs clean and **one line per event**.

---

9. No "Magic" or Hidden State
No global flags, hidden environment switches, or silent fallback logic. **All settings must be visible** at the top of the file or in `config.json`.

---

10. Every Module Must Have a Mini-README
Every folder (scraper, AI gen, deployer, UI) must include a short `README.md` explaining:
- What it does
- How to run it
- What inputs/outputs it expects

---

## üß™ Bonus Rule Zero: ‚ÄúIf it takes more than 10 seconds to figure out, it‚Äôs a comment.‚Äù
Every non-trivial line must be self-evident or explained in one line above it.
